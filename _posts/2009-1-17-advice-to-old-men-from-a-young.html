Unless you were shooting Kennedy, nobody cares where you were when Kennedy was shot.<br /><br />2. The left lane on the freeway is a young man's game.<br /><br />3. Things will always get more expensive.&nbsp; Bitching about the cost of gasoline isn't going to make it any cheaper.&nbsp; Corollary: nobody cares that a gallon of gasoline used to cost a nickel.<br /><br />4. War stories: keep them coming.<br /><br />5. If you have a prosthetic hook-arm, it's your duty to use it to scare children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corollary to #4, your prosthetic hook-arm makes a war story way better.&nbsp; If you didn't lose your arm in a war, make up a good war story to explain it.&nbsp; Nobody will know the difference.<br /><br />6. The world doesn't owe you anything.<br /><br />7. Respect your youngers.&nbsp; We're the ones who will pay your Social Security and take care of you when you're enfeebled.<br /><br />8. Advice you offer to young men should fall into one of these three categories:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The finer points of tolerable behavior when it comes to strippers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Recommendations on quality whiskeys<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Sticking it to the man<br /><br />9. If you're past the point where people depend on you, eat, smoke, drink, and gamble.&nbsp; We young men must control our vices, but you've earned the right to indulge with reckless abandon.&nbsp; Show us what we have to look forward to.<br /><br />10. You keep getting older, but they stay the same age.&nbsp; From a young man's perspective, a 65 year old man with a 23 year old woman isn't a shame, it's a victory.<br />
