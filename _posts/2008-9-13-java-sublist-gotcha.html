... and right down to the main() from here.<br /></pre>

<p>The suspect line in all this is ShingleDupeDetector.java:139, which is one of those <i>how-the-hell-are-you-hanging-on-this</i> lines:</p>

<pre>for (Integer x : someCollectionOfIntegers) {
</pre>

<p>So what the shit, right?</p><p>I was using this collection as a cache of sorts, where on every run, I chopped some data off the front of it and added some data to the back, keeping the collection size constant.&nbsp; To accomplish this, I used the <code>subList</code> method on <code>java.util.List</code>, something like this:</p><p><br /></p>
<pre>someCollectionOfIntegers = someCollectionOfIntegers.subList(fromIndex,
                                                    someCollectionOfIntegers.size());
someCollectionOfIntegers.addAll(incoming);
</pre>

<p>Well it turns out that <code>subList</code> didn't do what I thought it did.&nbsp; I assumed that I just got a new <code>List</code> that contained the elements in the given range of the original.&nbsp; Oh no, <code>subList</code> returns a <i>view</i> of the original list where only elements in the given range are addressable.&nbsp; A look at <code>AbstractList.java</code>'s source reveals this:</p>

<pre> 
public List&lt;E&gt; subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex) {
        return new SubList&lt;E&gt;(this, fromIndex, toIndex);
}
</pre>

<p>And the <code>SubList</code> object keeps a reference to <code>this</code>, as well as an offset to know where iteration starts, so as I updated the "cache", iterating over it became recursive.&nbsp; Oh, balls.&nbsp; That's why it's running slow.<br /></p>
