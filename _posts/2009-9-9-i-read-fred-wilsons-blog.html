Couple that with the youthfully cute thought that Silicon Valley is a meritocracy, and it was only a matter of time. We had build some neat technology behind the scenes, and I was very proud of a few key parts of the system, but in the end, the users just did not come.<br /><br />The trouble with this lesson is that it can only be learned the hard way. Arrogant people don't listen to criticism, they just run themselves into the wall.&nbsp; Incompetent people can usually be led in the right direction, even though they may execute their way into the dirt.&nbsp; Arrogance doesn't listen to reason, it only listens to itself.<br /><br />For example, an arrogant motorcyclist will ride on the highway at twice the speed of traffic, and no matter how many times he gets pulled over, and he'll keep doing it until he crashes.&nbsp; An incompetent motorcyclist will drop his bike in a U-turn in front of his house, cracking a mirror.<br /><br />This failure made me saltier. I now understand why old men have no patience for the modern world.&nbsp; However, it did not let me keep thinking that superior code is the solution to any conceivable problem. I've hunkered down a bit, concentrating on a new project that I really believe will be a winner, and started learning the business realities of a cruel Valley.<br /><br />So now, if an investor asks me what I learned from past failures, I won't put him to sleep talking about schema-less versus SQL databases. Instead, I've got a good answer.<br />
