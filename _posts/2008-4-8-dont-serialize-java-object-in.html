title: Don't Serialize Java Objects In Hadoop SequenceFiles
mt_id: 17

Not if you can avoid it, at least.<br /><br />Hadoop provides you with the <code>Writable</code> interface if you want to write your object to a <code>SequenceFile</code>.&nbsp; It's up to you to implement the <code>write()</code> and <code>readFields()</code> methods for your object.&nbsp; It's easy if your object is simple: just write each of your instance variables to a <code>DataOutput</code> and read them back in the same order from a <code>DataInput</code>.<br /><br /><b>Don't Write Your Object As A Serialized Byte Array<br /></b><br />I got lazy when I was implementing the Writable interface with one of our classes because it had a ton of instance variables.&nbsp; I figured I'd just serialize it to a byte array, then write the array length and the whole array to the DataOutput.&nbsp; And on the read, well, just unserialize the object from the byte array.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was my <code>write()</code>:<br /> 

<pre><code>
@Override
public void write(DataOutput out) throws IOException {
	ByteArrayOutputStream byteOutStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
	ObjectOutputStream objectOut = new ObjectOutputStream(byteOutStream);
		
	objectOut.writeObject(getContainedObject());
	objectOut.close();
		
	byte[] serializedObject= byteOutStream.toByteArray();
		
	out.writeInt(serializedObject.length);
	out.write(serializedModel);

}
</code></pre>

Naw, dude.  Bad idea.<br /><br />I knew that I'd be paying some overhead in both space and time for this little scheme, but I didn't know how much.&nbsp; It was just a little bit per object, but when we started seeing MapReductions take way too much time in I/O, it was time to revisit this.<br /><br /><b>What This Cost In Space And Time</b><br /><br />First, the Java serialization space overhead.&nbsp; On a toy example of this object, serialization to a byte array used 953 bytes.&nbsp; Properly writing out the instance variables consumed 296 bytes.&nbsp; In production, doing it the right way shrunk a 1,600-record <code>SequenceFile</code> from 1.4GB to 825MB.<br /><br />Time savings were great, too.&nbsp; In the same toy example, it took my JVM 7.2 milliseconds to serialize the object and 1.7 milliseconds to unserialize.&nbsp; Doing with with stream I/O only took 76,000 nanoseconds to serialize, 58,000 nanoseconds to unserialize.<br /><br />I love order-of-magnitude improvements.<br /><br />Lesson learned: get off your lazy ass and do it right.<br />
