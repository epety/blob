<img alt="not_illegal_in_thailand.jpg" src="/images/not_illegal_in_thailand.jpg" class="post-lead-image" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="267" width="334" /> <div>I have no formal training in natural language processing.&nbsp; As such, I figure out a lot of this shit on my own.<br /><br />One of the simplest concepts in NLP/text mining is stemming.&nbsp; If you're not in the know, to stem a word is to remove all the unnecessary shit after its root.<br /><br />For example, "computer", "computing" and "compute" all stem to "comput".&nbsp; Same root, virtually the same meaning.<br /><br />Something like this is clearly useful in a search engine like Pressflip, because if somebody searches for "iphone" (and a <i>lot</i> of you people are), the engine should pull up documents that contain the plural (iphones) of the word.<br /><br />The canonical algorithm for doing this sort of thing is called the Porter Stemming Algorithm, which considers each word on its own.&nbsp; Porter works great 99% of the time, but when it fails, it fucks you <i>hard</i>.<br /><br /><b>Why You Keep Tryin To Say That Word?</b><br /><br />A good example of this comes from the pressflip query logs.&nbsp; A user searched for "marketing".&nbsp; Perfectly reasonable.&nbsp; Porter stemmed that to "market", which returned a bunch of search results about the Dow Jones and Nasdaq.&nbsp; Ouch. Right in the butt.<br /><br />What went wrong?&nbsp; In smart-talk, the bare infinitive that corresponds to the gerund has a different meaning than the gerund.&nbsp; Again, I know dick-shit about NLP, so maybe you guys have a serious-business name for this sort of thing.<br /><br />So yeah, gerunds make Porter suck sometimes.<br /><br />There are some other failure cases I've discovered.&nbsp; Proper nouns will give it to you Clydesdale-style, too.&nbsp; More specifically, proper nouns that don't stem to themselves.&nbsp; Example: "Mariners" and "Marin" both share the same stem.&nbsp; So potentially, someone searching for the baseball team from Seattle will come up with news about the hoity-toity town across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.<br /><br />What's the answer to this?&nbsp; If you're a company with millions in VC lottery winnings, you can pay Basistech $100,000 for a 3-year license of their context sensitive stemmer.&nbsp; If you're me, though, you make exclusion lists.&nbsp; Big ones.<br /><br />That being said, after a large re-processing this weekend, Pressflip search quality is going to improve.<br /></div>
