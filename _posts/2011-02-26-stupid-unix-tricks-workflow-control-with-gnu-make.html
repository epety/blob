I was hacking around on part of a project last week that looked something like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
Fetch an API Response &rarr; Validate response &rarr; Munge response &rarr; Write response to a DB
</blockquote>


<p>If any of the steps fail, then the whole production should stop or else Bad Things happen. Furthermore, I would like to be able to pick up where I left off in the process, should one of the steps fail - the validate step was somewhat CPU intensive, so I'd rather not lose that work if it succeeds. This is a pretty common workflow, so I wanted to apply as much of the Unix Way to it as I could, in hopes that my solution would be easier and more robust. That turned out to be true.</p>

<h4>Makefile Abuse</h4>

<p>As chance would have it, GNU Make solved this problem for me without a whole lot of effort. Here's what my makefile looked like:</p>

<pre>
api_response.json:
    curl -o api_response.json http://api.company.com/endpoint

validated_response.json: api_response.json
    validate_response -o validated_response.json api_response.json

munged_response.json: validated_response.json
    munge_response -o munged_response.json validated_response.json

update_database: munged_response.json
    copy_response_to_db munged_response.json

clean:
    rm -f munged_response.json
    rm -f validated_response.json
    rm -f api_response.json

.PHONY: update_database clean
</pre>

<p>To execute the workflow, I invoke <code>make -f workflow.mk update_database</code>, which will do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Compute the dependency tree: <code>munged_response.json</code> depends on <code>validated_response.json</code> which depends on <code>api_response.json</code>.</li>
  <li>If any of these files is not on disk, it will recursively execute the <code>make</code> targets to build the missing ones.</li>
  <li>Update the database</li>
  <li>If any of the recursive execution fails (command returns nonzero), freak the fuck out and print an error message.</li>
</ol>

The <code>.PHONY</code> line tells <code>make</code> that the <code>clean</code> and <code>update_database</code> targets are always out of date, and need to be run every time.
</p>

<h4>Graceful and Robust</h4>
<p>There are a couple of things that I really like about this gadget:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Fail-fast execution:</em></strong> if any of the steps before <code>update_database</code> fail, the database doesn't get updated.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Pick up where you left off:</em></strong> if <code>munge_response</code> fails after the fetch and validate steps succeed, the next time it executes, it won't fetch & validate again unless I <code>make clean</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Small programs that do small things:</em></strong> instead of one monolithic program, there are 4 independent programs that perform the work: <code>curl</code>, <code>validate_response</code>, <code>munge_response</code>, and <code>copy_response_to_db</code>. This modular system is more debuggable and and robust than a single program that does everything.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Free parallelization where available:</em></strong> since the workflow is a linear dependency chain, <code>make</code> can't parallelize it. However, if there were another step that only depended on <code>munged_response.json</code>, say, <code>publish_munged_response</code>, <code>make</code> would be able to parallelize <code>publish_munged_response</code> and <code>update_database</code>, as they are not linearly dependent on one another.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could have used a pretty standard pipeline to solve this problem, for example:

<pre>
curl http://api.company.com/endpoint | validate_response | munge_response | copy_response_to_db
</pre>

But that would not satisfy the "pick up where you left off" requirement without some Aristocrats joke within each of the processing programs to track state, and pipelines are linear - it's hard to get the free parallelization without doing some shameful things.
<br/><br/>
Feels good, man.</p>
