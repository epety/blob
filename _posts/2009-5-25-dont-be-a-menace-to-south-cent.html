Because it's really pissing off people who make a living out of public relations.<br /><br />When I was writing Uncov, I would get several e-mails daily from PR agencies, pitching me a story on such and such a shitty startup.&nbsp; This is how it works: your company pays a PR agency for the size of their Rolodex.&nbsp; The PR agency spams the publications with your press release in hopes that the story gets picked up.&nbsp; In the tech media, the hit rate for PR isn't terribly high, so you end up spending upwards of $10,000 per month on PR that only gets your company a few writeups.&nbsp; It's a scam.<br /><br />A company like PayPerPost, now Izea, has removed that market inefficiency.&nbsp; You can simply pay bloggers directly to write about you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not they disclose that they're being paid, well, who gives a shit? You get the Google link juice, you get the attention, and if it comes out that you paid for it, the internet has the attention span of a fruit fly, so everyone will forget about in 24 hours.<br /><br />Any blogger that takes a stand against paid posting is delusionally self-important.&nbsp; There is no morality to "citizen journalism" by definition.&nbsp; The idea is that the traditional media will die in favor of hundreds of thousands of individual reporters, all working for themselves.&nbsp; The good ones will rise to the top, but everybody will keep talking.&nbsp; In this type of scheme, there is no force whatsoever that can stop paid placement.&nbsp; With a few large media outlets, like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other newspapers, paid placement isn't an issue because so much credibility is at stake.<br /><br />Not so on the internet.&nbsp; Complain about it all you want, but paid placement is a necessary side effect of user-generated media.&nbsp; Regulations against it are like speed limits: there's bound to be some marginal enforcement, but by and large, it does nothing to prevent it.&nbsp; <br /><br />It's what we wanted, now it's what we've got.<br />
