It's been an open secret that the project is <a href="http://milo.com/">Milo.com</a>, an online local comparison shopping engine.&nbsp; We index the inventory of stores nationwide and show you real-time, what is available around you. From an engineering perspective it's a cool problem because there is a lot of data to store and manage, as well as a lot of integration work to deal with the particular temperament of various retailers' inventory systems. Of course if it were easy, someone would have done it already.<br /><br />From a business perspective, I like it a lot. The online comparison shopping world is very crowded, and we didn't want to be just another me-too AdWords arbitrage/affiliate marketing site. When I got into this business, I thought that online shopping was like the Stairway to Heaven of Internet business, but with the local inventory lookup, I think we really have distinguished ourselves from the others out there.<br /><br />Today I'm happy to announce that we've closed a $4 million Series A investment round, led by True Ventures, with other investors such as Ron Conway, Aaron Patzer, and Jeff Clavier also participating.&nbsp; As a side note, I was really impressed by the True team, and am happy to be working with them. There were ups and downs to the Series A process, and I have to say that pitching the True partners was a definite up.<br /><br />Oh, right. We also have a mascot. His name is Milo, of course. Here he is attacking me at my desk:<br /><br /><img alt="what-is-it-about-dogs-and-face-licking.jpg" src="/images/what-is-it-about-dogs-and-face-licking.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="320" width="240" /><br /><br /><br /><div><br /></div>
