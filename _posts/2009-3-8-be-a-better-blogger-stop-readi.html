I guess it's a positive influence.<br /><br />If you want to keep that company, do so, but like programming, writing is so much better when you value elegance as well as functionality.<br /><br />Which brings me to my second point.&nbsp; Write less.<br /><br />For the last two months, I have been working my way through a pile of books: everything ever published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_palahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk</a> (tl;dr: the guy who wrote Fight Club).&nbsp; I'm almost done, a book and a half to go.&nbsp; Chuck likes to do these writers' workshops, and somebody once asked him what he does when he's stuck.&nbsp; He knows where the story needs to go, but just doesn't know how to get it there.<br /><br />Chuck's response: "Did you ever go into the bathroom and try and take a shit when you didn't have to go?"<br /><br />Whenever I sit down to write a post here, it's because I really have to take a dump.&nbsp; Incidentally, sometimes when I write for The Register, it feels like I'm really trying to squeeze one out.&nbsp; If I end up dead from an aneurysm, that's what happened.  Setting a post-per-week quota for yourself is like setting a lines-of-code quota at work.<br /><br />Don't write just because you want to spend some time on the pot.&nbsp; Do it because you really have to go.<br /></div>
