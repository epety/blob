else's screaming baby, you understand immediately why prostitution is
the world's oldest profession.  The first time you hold your own
screaming baby, you understand immediately why a federal prisoner who
gunned down three police officers needs no moral justification for
sticking the sharpened end of a toothbrush into a freshly jailed
child molester's kidney. <br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> It's that first revelation that scares many
first time fathers into escaping responsibility like a jackrabbit
from a coyote.  The difference between the ones who run and the ones
who stay, really, is how the news was broken to them:  a great
comedian will tell you that they key to any good joke is the
delivery.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">	A runner was out on a Tuesday night
with some of his friends at a bar, somewhere between his third drink
and fourth cigarette, when the girl he'd been fucking calls him up
and says that she's pregnant.  A dad who sticks around is
concentrating on some manly order of housework, like changing the oil
in a car, when his wife or girlfriend calls him in to make sure that
the little blue plus sign actually does mean &#8220;pregnant&#8221;, and that
she's not just misreading it.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">	With a baby in the house, the bedroom
is going to lose its understated but victorious smell of Astroglide
and unwashed sheets in favor of a strong presentation of rancid
breast milk.  When there's a child to take care of, getting falling
down drunk to the point where you're willing to argue with a street
vendor over the price of a 2AM hot dog isn't really an option in the
list of things to do this weekend.  With a baby, all of the money you
used to spend on video games and car accessories is going to be
repurposed for child care.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">	When a man runs from fatherhood, he's
not really running from responsibility, he's running from the guilt
of a mediocre life.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">	Without the responsibility of a baby,
there's still time to salvage it.  A month after disappearing,
though, a runner realizes the vicious truth: that no amount of time
or things-not-to-be-responsible-for will turn an unaccomplished life
into one your eventual children will look up to.  Fleeing your responsibility
and making that new year's resolution to get your life on track is as
effective as telling yourself that you have the courage to ask out a
girl as you masturbate.  No number of promises will ever amount to
motivation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">	For those of us that stay in the
picture, ambition has a new meaning. I'm twenty five years old, a
software engineer on the startup circuit in Silicon Valley.  I'm not
in the business so that I get invited to speak at conferences.  I'm
not an entrepreneur because I want to feel important.  I'm in this
game now to provide for my family.  At first, I thought that a
startup was the only part of my youth left breathing, but now, I know
that having a picture of my daughter stuck to my monitor is the best
motivation there is.  If you're the type to man up to what's demanded
of you, a baby won't throw your entrepreneurship game off.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Just make sure you're funded.</p>
