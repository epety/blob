<form mt:asset-id="62" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="see-also-hypertension.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2009/01/12/see-also-hypertension.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="240" width="320" /></form>If there's one thing I have a lot of contempt for, it's neo-hippie bullshit.&nbsp; However, my appreciation for fresh produce just barely overthrows this contempt, so sometimes I go shopping at <a href="http://www.berkeleybowl.com/">The Berkeley Bowl</a> for all kinds of fruits and vegetables that I've never heard of.&nbsp; Really, they have some wonky shit there.&nbsp; Ever see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha%27s_hand">Buddha's Hand</a>?<br /><br />Anyhoo, they sell sea salt there.&nbsp; Salt, like 'out the ocean.&nbsp; And people buy it.&nbsp; And those people are morons.<br /><br />If you buy sea salt, you're paying a premium for the luxury of being a douchebag.&nbsp; It's salt.&nbsp; It has no discernible flavor other than <i>salty</i>, it has no metric of quality other than <i>not mixed with dirt and glass shards</i>, and it should have no variation in price other than <i>cheap</i>.<br /><br />You can buy 4 pounds of standard issue table salt for $5.37 on the internet.&nbsp; Alternatively, I've seen 4 ounces of sea salt for sale for $2.39.&nbsp; That's a markup of roughly 712%.&nbsp; It's a pretty good business if you're selling salt.<br /><br />In fact, sea salt might even be bad for you.&nbsp; Regular salt has been used for years as a vehicle for iodine, a chemical your body needs to keep you from becoming a retard.&nbsp; No bullshit, iodine deficiency can cause mental retardation.&nbsp; It only costs a dollar or so to iodize a ton of salt, so it really is ideal.&nbsp; Most sea salt isn't iodized, because it's sold as "natural".&nbsp; Boy, a lesser product for way more money?&nbsp; Where do I sign up?<br /><br />Some people claim to be able to distinguish the "superior flavor" of sea salt.&nbsp; These are the same kinds of people who keep a fridge stocked with gallons of bottled water and don't use the tap for anything but watering a house cactus.&nbsp; If you are one of these people, you should kill yourself as a public service.&nbsp; The only real difference between sea salt and table salt you'll feel when you eat it is the coarseness of sea salt.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; And coarse salt isn't worth fucking ten dollars a pound.<br /><br />tl;dr if you're buying sea salt, consider yourself successfully marketed to.&nbsp; It's like Fiji water.&nbsp; You got hustled.<br />
