<form mt:asset-id="72" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="at-least-they-didnt-fuck-up-my-nvidia-drivers-this-time.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2009/04/25/at-least-they-didnt-fuck-up-my-nvidia-drivers-this-time.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="230" width="160" /></form>I upgraded to Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope today.&nbsp; It was a positive experience until I opened Pidgin and Evolution and started using my computer.&nbsp; Jaunty has this new feature called NotifyOSD that application makers can use to bug the shit out of you at every possible moment.&nbsp; Someone signed online? Bug the shit out of the user.&nbsp; Received an e-mail, bug the shit out of the user.&nbsp; Joined a wireless network?&nbsp; You guessed it.&nbsp; Let's bug the shit out of the user.<br /><br />The old notifier used to stay out of your way.&nbsp; Get a little message or whatnot when you got a new e-mail.&nbsp; It was unobtrusive and didn't distract you while you're trying to figure out why some little bit of SQLAlchemy code is making too many calls to a database.&nbsp; But now, Canonical has found it necessary to make sure you're abundantly aware of every excruciating detail of your computer's operation.&nbsp; Productivity be damned.<br /><br />I don't know whose bright idea this feature was, but whoever it is is trying to spread their terminal case of attention deficit disorder to the rest of the world.&nbsp; Fuck you.&nbsp; Grind up your Adderall pills and snort them until your heart shits out like a Chevy.<br /><br />Anyway, if you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the offending window:<br /><br /><form mt:asset-id="73" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="i-hope-youre-proud-of-yourself.png" src="http://teddziuba.com/2009/04/25/i-hope-youre-proud-of-yourself.png" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="476" width="733" /></form><b>How To Turn This Thing Off</b><br /><br />Open up a command line.&nbsp; Type this:<br /><br /><code>sudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service.disabled</code><br /><br />And restart your computer.&nbsp; You could probably restart the dbus daemon, but that makes a lot of things go ill on your machine.<br /><br />This disables the notifier for good.&nbsp; Now you can get back to work.<br />
