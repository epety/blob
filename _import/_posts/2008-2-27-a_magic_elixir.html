And I just discovered one.<br /><br />It's called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sea-Foam-Marine-Motor-Treatment/dp/B0002ZVMQO">Sea Foam</a>, and it will cure what ails 'ya.<br /><br />My wife's first motorcycle was a Honda Rebel 250.&nbsp; She upgraded too late in the season and couldn't sell the starter before winter showed up.&nbsp; Winter time is a dead zone for the used motorcycle market in the San Francisco Bay Area, so the Rebel sat in the parking garage for 5 months.&nbsp; Being lazy, I didn't properly store it.&nbsp; <br /><br />We went to fire it up yesterday to prepare it for its 15 minutes of Craigslist fame, and it wouldn't turn over.&nbsp; Gasoline, if left long enough, will degrade into a mucky varnish that cakes the inside of your carburetors.<br /><br />I poured half a can of Sea Foam into the tank and let it sit for a few minutes.&nbsp; I cranked it again and it made a few pathetic putts.&nbsp; A few more cranks, a few more putts, but after about 5 tries, the Rebel roared to life.<br /><br />A six dollar bottle of some petroleum distillate has the same end effect as a three hundred dollar carburetor job.<br /><br />I am detecting much win in this sector.<br /><br /><br />
