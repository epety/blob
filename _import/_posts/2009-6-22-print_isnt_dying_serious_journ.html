<form mt:asset-id="81" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="when-techcrunch-pays-writers-six-figures-then-arrington-can-talk-about-success.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2009/06/22/when-techcrunch-pays-writers-six-figures-then-arrington-can-talk-about-success.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="278" width="200" /></form> <div>It's a tired Silicon Valley drum beat: print is dying, blogs and Twitter are the future of news.&nbsp; Many in the business of blogging like to think that print ad revenues are declining and subscriber bases are shrinking because online media is vastly superior to those dinosaurs.&nbsp; This is one area where the evidence actually seems to suggest that the bloggers are justified.<br /><br />However, if you're not so full of yourself that "citizen journalism" seems like a revolution, you can understand the real reason that print is dying: <i>newspapers' shit is all retarded</i>.&nbsp; <br /><br />Too many big words, articles that are way too long, and boring stuff like researched facts.&nbsp; Fuck all that shit, I want my news as it happens, and I don't care how true it is.&nbsp; Bloggers call this process journalism...whatever.&nbsp; That's just writers trying to convince themselves that they're serious when they know deep down that their readership is only interested in sensational titles and text no longer than 300 words.&nbsp; Any more than that, well, shit's all retarded.<br /><br />The only satisfying part of journalism turning into shinythings.com is watching intellectuals whine about it.&nbsp; See, I probably should be an intellectual.&nbsp; I've got a degree in mathematics, I'm a computer programmer by trade, but every time I've knocked an article out of the park for The Register, it's been a great troll.&nbsp; That's the only way to get by in online media, and even the New York Times knows this.<br /><br />Take for example, NYT columnist Paul Krugman.&nbsp; He won a Nobel Prize in economics, and has been writing the same op-ed column for NYT for the past 8 years: "Republicans are the cause of all the world's ills."&nbsp; Someone who's shit is arguably all retarded has been reduced to trolling to get page views.&nbsp; And it really works.<br /><br />If, as a blogger, you're above trolling, then the only other way to be popular is by printing blatant falsehoods.&nbsp; In 2008, people actually started to pay attention to CNN's iReport because somebody wrote that Steve Jobs had a heart attack. Apple lost 10% of its market capitalization in 10 minutes.&nbsp; Now <i>that's</i> fucking power.&nbsp; TechCrunch's Michael Arrington, showing an obvious tell of a manic depressive, keeps going off on Last.FM with lies about them giving data away to the recording industry.&nbsp; None of it is true, but it brings readers.<br /><br />It certainly doesn't hurt that TechCrunch shies away from words longer than eight letters.<br /><br />Print media isn't hurting because it's an outdated business model, print media is hurting because it's boring.&nbsp; Blogs and Twitter are succeeding because their shit is clearly not retarded.&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; Intellectualism is dying, and the news is now anything we want it to be. <br /><br />I just can't wait until 4chan figures that out.<br /><br /><br /></div>
