We put out some new features in Pressflip yesterday.&nbsp; We've expanded the service to be a general "persistent search" that takes advantage of metadata.<br /><br />Collins, can we skip the technicals, please?&nbsp; What we've come up is an applications platform, so you can, for example, add the Reddit application and get Reddit.com content matched to your saved searches in Pressflip.&nbsp; You'll see a Reddit widget next to results that come from Reddit, like this, a result to my saved search about <i>cars</i>:<br /><br /><form mt:asset-id="44" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="reddit-example.png" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/09/30/reddit-example.png" class="mt-image-center" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="94" width="531" /></form><br /> <div>We've got more applications: Digg, Twitter, Fark, Topix, and a few others, along with the standard load of news, blogs, and magazines that we've always been indexing.&nbsp; There are some more in the pipe, but this is the general direction of our product.<br /><br />Our thinking is that there is a ton of data out there, some of it searchable, some of it not.&nbsp; If we can connect silos of data to your saved searches, then we can provide a better experience than say, Google Alerts.&nbsp; By taking advantage of APIs provided by various services, we can provide richer and more unified results.<br /><br />To illustrate this new platform better, I have come up with this awesome graphic:<br /><br /><form mt:asset-id="45" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="pf-conftent-sources.png" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/09/30/pf-conftent-sources.png" class="mt-image-center" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="300" width="420" /></form>As we add more content sources, we'll have a really unique saved search experience.<br /><br />So, check out <a href="http://www.pressflip.com/">pressflip.com</a> and see for yourself.<br /></div><div><br /></div>
