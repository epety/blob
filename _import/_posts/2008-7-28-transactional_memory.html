The next article in my column at El Reg is up.&nbsp; It's about transactional memory in Sun's upcoming Rock CPU.<br /><br />You can <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/28/sun_dziuba_tm/">read my article</a> and <a href="http://pressflip.com/s?q=%22transactional+memory%22&amp;x=Go">follow transactional memory</a> on pressflip.<br /><br />Cue the buttsore Brits in the comments whining about my language.<br />
