<br /><form contenteditable="false" mt:asset-id="1" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"></form>Because of Uncov, there have been a few butthurt responses to Persai.&nbsp; People want to tear us apart because we spent so much time tearing Web 2.0 down.&nbsp; That's fine, I applaud the effort, but if you are going to write a takedown, do it right.&nbsp; Halfassing it is just an embarrassment to the both of us.<br /><br />With that in mind, I think a first hand demonstration in writing a proper takedown would help bloggers.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>1. Have a Hook</b></font><br /><br />You, the blogger, are supposed to entertain me, the reader.&nbsp; Invoke a visceral reaction to get my attention.&nbsp; A funny title or good image macro will do.&nbsp; One of my favorite (and also most time-consuming) parts about Uncov was finding or making all of the image macros.&nbsp; Selecting an image for a post was the first step; the rest of the post would just follow from the image.<br /><div><form contenteditable="false" mt:asset-id="1" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="what-is-fail.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/02/09/what-is-fail.jpg/what-is-fail.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="290" width="434" /></form>
</div><div>I mean look at that thing.&nbsp; That dog failed <i>hard</i>.&nbsp; That's some funny shit.&nbsp; Doesn't it make you want to read this post?<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>2. Remind Me Again, Why Am I Reading This?</b></font><br /><br />Okay, you've hooked me in with a good image macro.&nbsp; Now don't lose me.&nbsp; Whether or not I come back to your blog depends now on your writing style.&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a brilliant programmer, which probably means you suck ass at writing.&nbsp; You know how you encourage that guy whose only programming skill comes from a cursory examination of a "PHP in 24 Hours" book, as long as he isn't working on your project?&nbsp; Yeah, well, writers feel the same way about you.&nbsp; Don't take it personally, you can't be good at everything.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, can.<br /><br />Define your own style.&nbsp; It's OK to be influenced by others, but don't supplant.&nbsp; These writers are your teachers.&nbsp; For me, they were <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/">Maddox</a>, <a href="http://www.tuckermax.com/">Tucker Max</a>, and a few lesser knowns.&nbsp; The most important thing is that you <i>have</i> a style.&nbsp; This style has to keep me interested.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>3. Go Over the Top</b></font><br /><br />Be mean.&nbsp; Be meaner than you ever thought you could be.&nbsp; After all, it's the <i>internet</i>.&nbsp; Nobody <i>really</i> takes you seriously.<br /><br />Your goal is a takedown, not a gentle harangue.&nbsp; Instead of <i>"I'm not sure this product will get any traction"</i>, say <i>"the founders of this company should consider suicide"</i>.&nbsp; Pussyfooting around like that will make your takedown lame.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>4. Get Your Facts Right</b></font><br /><br />I have been burned by this before.&nbsp; For the most part, your readers don't give a shit because you're entertaining them, but it's personally embarrassing to screw this up.&nbsp; I got a lot of my facts wrong in a takedown of Middio (which, by the way, is now dead, thank you very much).&nbsp; I was ashamed of this, but then I remembered how awesome I was for making fun of a kid who was in high school.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>5. Linkbait</b></font><br /><br />Last but not least, you should linkbait your target.&nbsp; Yeah, you want them to read your takedown, but more importantly, you want them to whine in the comments.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the target's whining is at least if not more entertaining than your article.<br />&nbsp; <br /><b>Protip:</b> if you are the subject of a takedown, the <i>worst thing</i> you can do is try to defend yourself in the comments.&nbsp; It makes you look like you care what some shithead blogger has to say about you.&nbsp; If you do care that much about the critics, maybe starting a company isn't for you.<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>tl;dr</b></font><br /><br />If you're going to write a takedown, do it right.&nbsp; Make it funny.&nbsp; Don't suck at writing.&nbsp; Most importantly, though: don't take yourself too seriously, because your readers don't, either.<br /></div>
