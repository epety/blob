<form contenteditable="false" mt:asset-id="31" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="dogskype.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/08/01/dogskype.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="221" width="294" /></form> <div>One of the most common butthurt reactions to web services is the login barrier.&nbsp; Forcing people to create an account before they can use your product makes a <i>lot</i> of potential users say fuck it.<br /><br />I was eating dinner with <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> the other night, and even <i>he</i> gives up on a product that asks him to create an account.&nbsp; If technical users won't fill in three text boxes and click OK, what hope is there for the users that will actually click on ads?<br /><br />To this end, we've removed the login barrier from Pressflip.&nbsp; Anyone can show up and create an interest without making a new account.&nbsp; We pushed this change out yesterday (with <b>significant</b> amounts of fail surrounding the deployment - sorry to all of you who won a 500 error), and the number of interests created has increased drastically in only 12 hours, as has the RSS usage.<br /><br />Anyway, here are a few of the things I am following, and you can follow them too, without even giving us your e-mail address:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://pressflip.com/s?q=alternative+energy&amp;x=Go">Alternative energy</a></li><li><a href="http://pressflip.com/s?q=nuclear+power&amp;x=Go">Nuclear power</a></li><li><a href="http://pressflip.com/s?q=president+running+mate&amp;x=Go">President running mate</a></li><li><a href="http://pressflip.com/s?q=beijing+olympics&amp;x=Go">Beijing Olympics</a></li></ul>Yeah, I know that's shameless, but when we ask people "what are you interested in?", one of the commons responses is "uh, I dunno".&nbsp; I think the homepage copy needs a bit of reworking.<br /><br />Haulin' ass, gettin' paid.<br /></div>
