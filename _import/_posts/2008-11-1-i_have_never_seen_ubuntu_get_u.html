title: I Have Never Seen Ubuntu Get Upgrades Right

Ubuntu upgrades always, always, <i>always</i> fuck up the same things: network connections and graphics drivers.&nbsp; Without fail, if you upgrade, your wireless connection won't work and any closed-source video card drivers you need will get ill.&nbsp; 8.10 Intrepid Ibex is no exception.<br /><br />I figured out how to get my wireless connection back, but the NVidia drivers are still a mystery.&nbsp; I don't care about free software idealism, I care that my shit <i>works</i>.&nbsp; I'm willing to jump through minor hoops to make it work, like Ubuntu's "restricted drivers" lecture, but now that doesn't even work:<br /><br /><form mt:asset-id="53" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="intrepid-fucked.png" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/11/01/intrepid-fucked.png" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="573" width="505" /></form><br /><br />Why is this such a pain in the balls?&nbsp; I press the activate button and nothing happens. AWESOME. Just because I'm used to wasting hours fixing things like this doesn't mean I enjoy it.<br /><br />NVidia has 70-ish percent market share of all GPUs.&nbsp; If your shit doesn't work out of the box on 70% of the graphics cards out there, who has failed?<br /><br /><b>[Update, the next day]:</b>&nbsp; I found the fix.&nbsp; Navigate to System &gt; Administration &gt; Synaptic Package Manager.&nbsp; From there, go to Settings &gt; Repositories.&nbsp; In the "Ubuntu Software" tab, check the "Proprietary device drivers" box.&nbsp; Or edit /etc/apt/sources.list if you want to show your chest hair.<br /><br />I'm glad to see that passive-aggressive Debian superiority is alive and well.&nbsp; <br />
