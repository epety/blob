<form contenteditable="false" mt:asset-id="21" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="pissed_dog_deer.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/07/01/1207953741759.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="350" width="371" /></form>Starting today, I'll be writing a bi-weekly (that's every other week, not twice a week, you dunce) column at The Register.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I'm just that awesome.<br /><br />Here are the answers to a few of the questions I've got so far:<br /><i><br />What are you going to write about?</i><br />Not startups, thank Christ.&nbsp; It's going to be more developery.<br /><br /><i>Does this make you a sellout?</i><br />Yes, insofar as I (and other sellouts before me) have bills to pay in the part of the country that has the highest cost of living.&nbsp; If I really wanted to sell out, I'd have taken the job that Arrington offered me at TechCrunch.<br /><br /><i>Why not write for TechCrunch of Valleywag?</i><br />Because I like the audience better at El Reg.&nbsp; The people who read The Register are the boots-on-the-ground in technology.&nbsp; These are the DBAs, the J2EE developers, and the sys admins who are there every day, supporting the infrastructure that runs the world outside of San Francisco. These are the people I identify with the most. Delusion of grandeur?&nbsp; Maybe, but no more deluded than thinking Valleywag matters to anybody outside the 510 and 650 area codes.<br /><i><br />Can I pitch you my startup like I did every fucking month at Uncov?</i><br />Sure, but my rule is that you need to buy me a drink before you start speaking.&nbsp; I'm not going to write anything about what you're doing, but if you want the honor of my attention it will cost you at least one Maker's Mark.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/14/dziuba_google_protocol_buffer/">Read the first one here</a>.&nbsp; It's about protocol buffers.<br /><br />
