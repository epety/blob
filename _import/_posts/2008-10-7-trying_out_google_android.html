I tried to write an Android app, got bored, and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/06/dziuba_android/">wrote about it at El Reg</a>.<br /><br />Also, by coincidence, my article is showing up at the top of the Pressflip <a href="http://pressflip.com/topic/Android">Android News</a> page.&nbsp; I swear, the ranker isn't hacked to do that.&nbsp; That will change as more stories come in.<br />
