Prior to 1967, it was legal for a citizen of California, who wasn't otherwise prohibited from doing so, to walk around in public with a loaded gun in plain sight.&nbsp; To have a concealed gun, you'd need a permit as you do today, but a holstered pistol on your hip for all to see was fine.&nbsp; In July of '67, the state legislature passed a bill making "open carry" illegal.<br /><br />Why?&nbsp; Did guns all of the sudden get more dangerous?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Two months prior to that, a group of Black Panthers staged a protest in Sacramento, fully armed, and within the bounds of the law.&nbsp; State legislators, it seemed, did not appreciate this sort of <i>interactive</i> constituency.<br /><br />In November of this year, California voters passed Proposition 8, banning gay marriage.&nbsp; State-wide, toothless protests ensued, and the internet was abuzz with whining.&nbsp; Now, I'm not in the business of wasting my time worrying about who marries who, nor am I in the business of being offended on behalf of someone else, but saying that <i>Gay Is The New Black</i> is more of a way to sell magazines than it is to motivate action.&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, spreading this idea is fueling the embarrassing <i>chickenshit activism</i> we're seeing against Prop. 8 and the like.<br /><br />This is a civil rights issue, so man the fuck up and treat it like one.<br /><br />Why all the Play-Skool protests?&nbsp; <br />
