<form mt:asset-id="48" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="1223613629088.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/10/18/1223613629088.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="189" width="251" /></form> <div>I made the decision last week to leave Pressflip.<br /><br />I'm leaving for personal reasons: mostly because I'm going to be a father in March and need some stability, but also because I'm tired of the fight.<br /><br />Entrepreneurship is very emotionally and physically taxing, and it's too much for me at this point in my life.&nbsp; Maybe I will pick it up again when I've got more experience under my belt.<br /><br />I'm not sure yet where I'll end up.&nbsp; I'm working on a couple of options.<br /><br />The product is in good hands.&nbsp; Matt and Kyle will continue to develop Pressflip, and I'll continue to be a user.&nbsp; <br /><br />When my kid is born, maybe I'll finally sign up for Flickr.<br /><br /><b>Update, 10/18/08:</b> TechCrunch has picked up on this.&nbsp; As is Michael Arrington's usual style, he is showing his personal vendetta against me to mischaracterize what I've said.&nbsp; My priorities have changed.&nbsp; I am now facing fatherhood, and I want to do what is best for my family.<br /><br />This is horrifically irresponsible on Michael's part, but that sort of thing is to be expected.&nbsp; Michael, you should be ashamed of yourself.<br /><br /><br /></div>
