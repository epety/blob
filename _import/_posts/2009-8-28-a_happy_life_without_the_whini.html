New Englanders are generally pretty educated people. We keep to ourselves. We vote. We donate money to causes, and for the most part, <i>we shut the fuck up</i>.&nbsp; Personally, I'm registered to one of the two major parties in the US. (If you tried to guess, you'd probably guess wrong.)&nbsp; I don't get into political arguments because I've got better shit to do. I don't blog about politics because I know that nobody cares what I think. You know what? It's a good life.<br /><br />Lately, I've been hearing a lot about this Glenn Beck fellow. I don't know who he is or what he said to get everyone so sore-assed, but I sure as shit don't care. I don't watch CNN or Fox News. I don't have cable TV. I get all my news from my local news channel over the air. No talking heads, no shouting matches, no six-second-attention-span scrolling tickers on the bottom of the screen. In 30 morning minutes, I get a brief summary of what the president said at such and such a meeting the other day, a look at the traffic and weather for the day, and some feel-good community segment. <br /><br />The last thing I need on a 40 mile motorcycle ride to work is a head full of piss, thanks to Bill O'Reilly or Keith Olbermann.<br /><br />But I can tell you that from the inside, generating butthurt is big business. Every time I've knocked an article out of the park for The Register, there's been a decent troll element to it. Not all trolls succeed, but the ones that hit a nerve really bring in the page views and comments. That's just the IT world. If I could get a job trolling politics, I'd be damn sure to demand a page view bonus. I can't knock the hustle.<br /><br />The news networks aren't stupid. They know that viewership increases when people are pissed off.&nbsp; Walter Cronkite delivered facts, but was a crusty old book report of a man for it.&nbsp; I'm sure that all else equal, if national media never figured out how much fucking money there is to be made in keeping people salty, the news would still be a puff of dry air.<br /><br />So I don't watch network TV. I don't blog about politics. It's a calm life. I have informed opinions on most issues, but I know that nobody cares what I think, so I keep to myself.&nbsp; Maybe that's why I still have trouble "getting" Twitter.<br /><br /></div>
