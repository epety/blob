I took a new job at a software company in Palo Alto, which means an 80 mile commute every day through Bay Area combat traffic.&nbsp; The first two weeks wore hard on my motorcycle - a 14 year old Ninja 500.&nbsp; Last week on my ride home, the left turn signal stopped working.&nbsp; Fuck.<br /><br />If you thought debugging a software problem was hard, try debugging a hardware problem.&nbsp; There are some salient facts about hardware problems that make them a real bitch:<br /><br /><ol><li>You need to buy a lot of tools.</li><li>There's a real possibility that you will fuck something up beyond repair.</li><li>There's a real possibility that you will injure yourself.</li><li>If it's your primary vehicle, you need to have it up and running on Monday.<br /></li></ol>A blinker light stops working, which means electricity isn't flowing.&nbsp; Sounds easy, but to get access to the wires, I needed to take the whole damn thing apart:<br /><br /><form mt:asset-id="58" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;" contenteditable="false"><img alt="close_up_small.JPG" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/11/24/close_up_small.JPG" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="410" width="547" /></form><br /> <div>You know how when you're writing software for a client, and they completely underestimate the amount of time and effort required to build something?&nbsp; Yeah, the same goes for auto mechanics.&nbsp; Don't bitch about a shop's $75/hr labor rate or their diagnosis fee.<br /></div>
