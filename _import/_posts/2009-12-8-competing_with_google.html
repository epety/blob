title: Competing with Google

Earlier this week, Google announced that they would be proving real-time availability information for results in their Product Search. This is one of the core functionalities of Milo, and in fact, it is one area of the product for which I am the lead engineer. And so it will be that two years after I left, I am geared up to compete head on with my former employer - the company that brought me to Silicon Valley.<br /><br />Myself and the rest of the Milo team are ready.<br /><br />So, as a startup, what do you do when Google announces they will be competing with you? First, foremost, and most importantly, put on some Warren Zevon. <i>Excitable Boy</i>.&nbsp; If Google is going to compete with you, it means that your company is in a valuable space. Note that Google did not announce that they're building a URL shortener.<br /><br />Secondly, do not worry. Remember, <b>every time that Google has entered a market outside of search, they have failed to build a dominating product.</b> Google is very good at building me-too, runner-up products. Take Google Local for example. It has been around for far longer than Yelp, but Yelp controls the local services market.&nbsp; Google Video was a flaccid response to YouTube. While YouTube users were watching <i>Lazy Sunday</i>, Google Video users were having an awesome time with old episodes of <i>Mr. Magoo</i>.<br /><br />You do not have to worry about Google building a superior product, because they cannot.&nbsp; Why? Because the types of problems that Google engineers like to solve are rarely the types of problems that the real world needs solutions to. Let's take shopping for example. Google's Product Search is a fine example of what you can do with low-hanging fruit data. They expect XML file uploads from merchants that contain product and inventory data.<br /><br />Anybody can do that. In fact, Shopping.com has been doing it for ages, along with virtually every other large comparison shopping engine. There is no real innovation. Google engineers like to solve problems with algorithms, not elbow grease.&nbsp; That's why Google usually does a poor job with semistructured data - they rely too much on science and not enough on <i>getting shit done</i>.<br /><br />This unwillingness to dive in to a problem that your average Stanford PhD feels is below him produces a key difference between Google and Milo. When Google will display availability information, their data is only as fresh as the last upload from the merchant. When Milo displays availability information, our data is as fresh as <b>right now</b>. Milo's inventory system is truly real-time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Google's shortcoming here actually defeats the purpose of showing availability data. For example, right now, it's the holiday season. Parents everywhere are searching for <a href="http://milo.com/search?q=zhu+zhu+pet">Zhu Zhu Pets</a>, which are the hot toy of the year. They sell out quickly. If you're relying on Google's inventory data and it's even hours old, you're likely to get burned.<br /><br />So no, I am not worried about Google. If they move in to your back yard, you shouldn't worry, either. Also, if you're a Python engineer who is not afraid to do some dirty work and solve difficult problems, <a href="http://milo.com/jobs">Milo is hiring</a>.<br />
