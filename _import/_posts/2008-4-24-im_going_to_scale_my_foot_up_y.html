<form contenteditable="false" mt:asset-id="6" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="1205210029413.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/24/1205210029413.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="166" width="399" /></form> <div>Engineers love to talk about scalability.&nbsp; It makes us feel like the bad ass, dick-swingin' motherfuckers that we wish we could be.<br /><br />After we talk about scalability with our co-workers (<i>Yeah, Rails doesn't scale!</i>), we flex our true engineering prowess by writing a post about it on our blog.&nbsp; Once that post hits Reddit, son, everyone will know <i>how hardcore</i> you really are.&nbsp; Respect.<br /><br /><b>People Who Talk Big About Scalability Don't Need To Worry About It</b><br /><br />Fact:&nbsp; every chest-thumping blog post I have seen written about scalability is either about architecture, Memcached, or both.&nbsp; Some asshole who writes shitty code starts pontificating about <i>"scalable architecture"</i> with data storage, web frontends, whatever-the-fuck.&nbsp; Dude, your app isn't having scalability problems because of the <i>architecture</i>.&nbsp; It's having scalability problems because you coded a ton of N^2 loops into it and you're too self-important to get peer reviews on your commits.<br /><br />And let's not forget the tools who discover Memcached for the first time, install it on a web server, and notice how fast their app runs now.&nbsp; Yeah, welcome to the modern age.&nbsp; Hope you know what a cache expiry policy is.<br /><br /><b>If You Haven't Discussed Capacity Planning, You Can't Discuss Scalability</b><br /><br />You don't need to worry about scalability on your Rails-over-Mysql application because nobody is going to use it.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Believe me.&nbsp; You're going to get, at most, 1,000 people on your app, and maybe 1% of them will be 7-day active.&nbsp; Scalability is not your problem, getting people to give a shit is.<br /><br />Unless you know what you need to scale <i>to</i>, you can't even begin to talk about scalability.&nbsp; How many users do you want your system to handle? A thousand?&nbsp; Hundred thousand? Ten million?&nbsp; Here's a hint: the system you design to handle a quarter million users is going to be different from the system you design to handle ten million users.<br /><br />Of course you'll point to the engineer's wet dream: linear scalability.&nbsp; <i>Lulz but when we get more users we just add more machines you are so stupid ted. uncov sucks.</i><br /><br />Yeah, great, well it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Oh no, go ahead and try out Amazon SimpleDB and think to yourself that it will scale linearly.&nbsp; Then, when you get enough users that the latency becomes a problem, blame it on "those shitty Amazon datacenters".<br /><br /><b>Choosing Technology Don't Mean Shit If You Don't Know How To Use It</b><br /><br />The most common butthurt about scalability is this:&nbsp; choose a technology.&nbsp; If you like the technology, claim <i>"technology X scales better!"</i> If you don't like it, claim <i>"technology X doesn't scale!"</i><br /><br />Saying "Rails doesn't scale" is like saying "my car doesn't go infinitely fast".&nbsp; Alternatively, saying "We'll have no problems scaling because we're using Django" is like saying "I will win every race because my car is the most powerful".&nbsp; Maybe so, but you suck at driving, and you're up against professionals.<br /><br />If you're having scalability problems and blaming it on a single technology, chances are, you're doing it wrong.<br /><br /><b>tl;dr</b><br /><br />Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.<br /></div>
