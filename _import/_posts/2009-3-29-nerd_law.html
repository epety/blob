If you've ever worked on a startup or other project that needs some data crawled from the web, I'm sure you've come up against robots.txt.&nbsp; If you've ever written a program that interfaces with some web service API, I'm sure you've worked around only being able to make so many requests per day, and so many requests per second.&nbsp; The way you handle these unenforceable rules of civility is a good predictor how how successful your project is going to be.<br /><br />Robots.txt, API limitations, and other such passive-aggressive assertions are perfect examples of what I call <i>nerd law</i>.&nbsp; A nerd law is any rule that can only be enforced programmatically, meaning there's no police officer sticking a gun in your face yelling <i>"go over five queries per second and I'll blow your fucking head off!"</i>&nbsp; <br /><br />Ninety nine times out of one hundred, if you are following nerd law, pack it up now because you're just too much of a pussy to manage this project.&nbsp; Having to work around nerd law wastes time, and showing respect to it proves that you don't have the hint of sociopathy necessary to succeed in business.&nbsp; There that one percent edge case, if your operation isn't fly-by-night, like building a search engine, and you don't have Google-sized market share to stand on and say <i>fuck you</i>.&nbsp; The rest of the time, get your data by any means necessary.<br /><br />Suppose you're running an SEO hustle and need some textual data to make your landing pages look legitimate.&nbsp; You decide you're going to crawl a few bulletin board forums to get some text.&nbsp; Oh no, the webmaster has a robots.txt file in place that keeps you out!&nbsp; Oh no, they only allow Googlebot in there!&nbsp; <i>This sort of fiefdom declaration can not go unpunished.</i>&nbsp; Spin up a few hundred threads, hit them with everything you got.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because fuck them, that's why.&nbsp; Sure, they may block you, but most times there's no automated system in place, so the very same admin who wrote the robots file will have to shut you down.&nbsp; You can probably get all the data you need before he figures out what's going on (which is why you spin 100 threads to do it).&nbsp; Sure, you've broken nerd law, but you have the data you need.&nbsp; It may be unkind, but you can't go to jail for it.<br /><br />If they shut you down before the work is done, remember this: it's easier to get a new IP address than it is to engineer a new way to get your data.<br />
