<form contenteditable="false" mt:asset-id="13" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="1204606927018.jpg" src="http://teddziuba.com/2008/06/30/1204606927018.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="312" width="300" /></form>Matt, Kyle and I are wrapping things up for the public launch.&nbsp; I have spent the last week writing Nagios alerts for some really esoteric details of our system.&nbsp; We're sending Persai out into the world in July, if everything goes right.&nbsp; It has been a long time coming - the system has been in development for over a year.<br /><br /><b>That Ride Sucks, Anyway</b><br /><br />Why is this thing taking so long to launch?&nbsp; We've had a lot of failures along the way, but we've finally converged on a system that I believe to be correct.&nbsp; The focus of the product has changed a little bit, too.<br /><br />Our pitch used to be: <i>a content filtering and delivery system that learns about what you're really interested in, and shows you news based on your feedback.</i><br /><br />That doesn't sit too well with investors, it turns out.<br /><br />Now, it's: <i>a persistent search that learns the nuanced details of what you like.</i><br /><br />That one picked up a few ears, and got a few pens working.<br /><br />We ended up re-writing the internals of this beast three times before we had what's running today.&nbsp; Now it's lean and mean.&nbsp; Our classifiers went through a massive reduction in feature space: about six orders of magnitude.&nbsp; Some of our linguistics algorithms got ten times faster, and we are crawling thousands more sources.<br /><br />The next couple of weeks are going to be very busy and very exciting.&nbsp; We will likely have a launch party, but we're not pissing away our investors' money on it.&nbsp; It'll be a barbecue in the back yard of the "office" with a bunch of beer.&nbsp; Maybe 111 Minna next time.<br />
